## Question 1 - Load the Data Set

```{r}
# Load the data set
grades <- read_csv("grades.csv")

```

```{r}
nrow(grades)
```
#Simple analyses
## Question 2 - Number of Grades

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Calculate and display the sentence with the number of grades
paste("The data set contains", nrow(grades), "grades.")
```

## question 3 
```{r}
# Create a new data frame with unique students and their groups
unique_students <- grades %>%
  distinct(id, group)

# Calculate the number of unique students
num_students <- nrow(unique_students)

```

## Preview of the Last Five Rows of the Grades Data Set

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Display the last five rows of the grades data frame
grades |>
  slice_tail(n = 5) |>
  knitr::kable()
```
## question 4 
```{r}
# Create a students data frame with unique student IDs and groups
students <- grades |> distinct(id, group)

# Display the first few rows of the students data frame
students |> slice_head(n = 5) |> knitr::kable()
```
## question 5 
```{r}
# Calculate the number of students per group
students_per_group <- students |>
  count(group)
```

```{r}
# Create a bar plot of the number of students per group with colors
ggplot(students_per_group, aes(x = factor(group), y = n, fill = factor(group))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Number of Students per Group", x = "Group", y = "Number of Students") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() 
```
#question 6 
```{r}
# Filter for the course "Archery and Marksmanship" and compute the average grade per group
archery_avg <- grades |>
  filter(course == "Archery and Marksmanship") |>
  group_by(group) |>
  summarise(avg_grade = mean(grade, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot the average grade per group using geom_col()
ggplot(archery_avg, aes(x = factor(group), y = avg_grade, fill = factor(group))) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Average Grade in Archery and Marksmanship by Group", x = "Group", y = "Average Grade") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() # Optional, use a color scale for differentiation
```
## question 7 

```{r}
# Box plot comparing grade distributions between the two semesters
ggplot(grades, aes(x = factor(semester), y = grade, fill = factor(semester))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Grade Distribution by Semester", x = "Semester", y = "Grade") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = "Semester")
#comment;
"it seems that the second semester has higher grades then the first one but idk why maybe they have more experince"
